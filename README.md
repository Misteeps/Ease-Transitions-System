# ETS - Ease Transitions System
ETS is a tool to easily test and apply [ease](https://easings.net/en) transitions to component values in [Unity](https://unity.com/).  
Tween 2D and 3D animations quickly with a simple but powerful system that allows for user flexibility.

ETS allows for time based transitions to properties in components _(Position.X value in Transform)_.  
Values are dynamically transitioned so that values will not snap and instead continue the transition from anywhere.

ETS has a ridiculously low overhead, only containing a single MonoBehaviour Update() to transition all set GameObjects.

Of course, the gif showcase above was made in Unity with ETS.

> Warning: There was a major mistake in data file serialization  
> Attempting to use older data files with the editor window may wipe saved transitions  
> Please make a backup of any data files created with release 1.0 before using it in the master branch version  
> It is recommended to finish editing old data files with release 1.0 and exporting to script  
> ###### Feel free to ignore this if you have not used ETS or it's editor window before

## Editor Window
ETS comes with a custom editor window that can be found under **[Tools/Ease Transitions Editor]**.

The custom editor window allows for:
- Organization of transitions with groups and objects
- Applying transitions quickly with ease _(ba-dum tsss)_
- Visualization and testing of one or more transitions simultaneously in the editor (without using the play button)
- Exporting to code easily by displaying template code

Full [Usage and Documentation](https://github.com/Misteeps/Ease-Transitions-System/wiki/Editor-Window).

> ETS can be used to apply transitions to gameobjects with or without the editor window.

> Warning: Unity has a new UI in 2019.3  
> Editor Window UI is designed for version 2019.3  
> Editor Window UI for versions 2019.2 and older is different and messy, but will still work

## Examples

> *Left*  
> 4 diamonds, each being transitioned from 30 to 0 in 2 seconds.  
> The timers at the bottom show when each diamond reaches the end.  
> Diamonds closer to the end take less time than diamonds further from the end.  
> Diamonds past the start do not take longer than the set duration.

> *Below*  
> Each ball is transitioned from top to bottom with different ease functions.
