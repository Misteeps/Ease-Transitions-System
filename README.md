# ETS - Ease Transitions System
ETS is a tool to easily test and apply [ease](https://easings.net/en) transitions to component values in [Unity](https://unity.com/).  
Tween 2D and 3D animations quickly with a simple but powerful system that allows for user flexibility.

ETS allows for time based transitions to properties in components _(Position.X value in Transform)_.  
Values are dynamically transitioned so that values will not snap and instead continue the transition wherever it is currently.

Of course, the gif above was made with ETS.

## Editor Window
ETS comes with a custom editor window that can be found under **[Tools/Ease Transitions Editor]**.

The custom editor window allows for:
- Organization of transitions with groups and objects
- Applying transitions quickly with ease _(ba-dum tsss)_
- Visualization and testing of one or more transitions simultaneously in the editor (without using the play button)
- Exporting to code easily by displaying template code

Full [Usage and Documentation](https://github.com/Misteeps/Ease-Transitions-System/wiki/Editor-Window).

> ETS can be used to apply transitions to gameobjects with or without the editor window.

> Warning: Unity has a new UI in 2019.3  
> Editor Window UI is designed for version 2019.3  
> Editor Window UI for versions 2019.2 and older is different and messy, but will still work
