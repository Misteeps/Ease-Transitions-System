# ETS - Ease Transitions System
ETS is a tool to easily test and apply [ease](https://easings.net/en) transitions to component values in [Unity](https://unity.com/).  
Tween 2D and 3D animations quickly with a simple but powerful system that allows for user flexibility.  

ETS allows for time based transitions to individual values in a component _(Position.X value in Transform)_.  
Values are dynamically transitioned so that values will not snap and instead continue the transition wherever it is currently.

## [Installation](https://github.com/Misteeps/Ease-Transitions-System/wiki/Setup-Guide)

- Transform
- Sprite Renderer
- Rect Transform
- Image
- Text

## [Editor Window](https://github.com/Misteeps/Ease-Transitions-System/wiki/Editor-Window)
ETS comes with a custom editor window that can be found under **[Tools/Ease Transitions Editor]**.  
The custom editor allows for:  
- Organization of transitions with groups and objects
- Applying transitions with ease _(ba-dum tsss)_
- Visualization and testing of one or more transitions simultaneously without using the play button
- Simple exports to code for more user control

> ETS can be used to apply transitions to your gameobjects with or without the editor window.  

> Warning: Unity has a new UI in 2019.3  
> Editor Window UI is designed for version 2019.3  
> Editor Window UI for versions 2019.2 and older is different and messy, but will still work  

## Quick Start (Will be replaced with in-depth documentation soon)
- Add EaseTransitions.cs anywhere to the scene
- Open the Ease Transitions Editor from "Tools/Ease Transitions Editor"
- Create asset file "Ease Transitions Data" and store in Editor Folder

>- Insert asset file into editor window
>- Create Groups
>- Create Elements and insert/search gameobjects
>- Select transition options and add components to transition
>- Copy templated code and paste into game code
